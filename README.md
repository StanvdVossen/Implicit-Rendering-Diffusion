# Implicit-Rendering-Diffusion
Using a [latent diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) image model for implicit 3D rendering.

Code coming ASAP. Small demo [here](https://thissneakerdoesnotexist.com/3D/).

Sneaker model weights can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13tyTTIgjwgZ-QFa22y6kdjsS_KPcd5Jr/view?usp=share_link).

The model is able to generate novel views from existing and non-existing sneakers in high-resolution.

The also works on high-resolution generated sneakers from other models. The following is made from a Midjourney creation.
